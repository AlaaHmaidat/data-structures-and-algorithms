# Linked List Kth
k-th value from the end of a linked list.

input : a number
output : Nodeâ€™s value

## Approach & Efficiency

1. __init__(self): Initializes an empty linked list with a None value for head.

2. append(self, new_value): Inserts a new node with the given value at the end of the linked list.

    * Create a new node with the new_value.

    * If the linked list is empty (i.e., head is None), set head to the new node.
    * Otherwise, traverse the linked list until the end (temp.next is None) and set the next pointer of the last node to the new node.

3. kthFromEnd(self, k): Searches in the linked list for a node with the given index (k)
    * Create a temp which equal self.head.
    * Create a length variable which equal zero to calculate the length of the linked list

    * While temp not none increase length by 1 and make temp equal temp.next

    * Create a current which equal self.head.
    * Create a count which equal length-1 because we need start from zero.

    * While current not none
    * check if k less than 0 or grater than the length return Exception
    * Otherwise, if the count equal k return the value (current.value)
    * Otherwise, decrease the count by 1 and make current equal current.next and continue looping
    
### Big O
__init__: O(1)
append: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, because in the worst case we need to traverse the entire linked list to find the last node to append the new node.

kthFromEnd: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, because in the worst case we need to traverse the entire linked list to find the value of the node.

The space complexity of this implementation is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, because we need to store all of the nodes in memory.
